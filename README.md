# DH100-MyAnimeList-Project

This is a mapping of 1500 anime titles by genre similarity via [TF-IDF](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/) and [force-directed graph drawing](https://toucantoco.com/en/glossary/force-directed-graph.html).

Before attempting to run any of the code in this project, download the [Azathoth MyAnimeList dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist) from Kaggle and extract the filtered versions of each CSV to the project folder.

A video presenting the process and results of this project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/uUUjgepARv4).
